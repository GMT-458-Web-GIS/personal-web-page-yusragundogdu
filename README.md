# Personal Portfolio Website for Web-GIS Course

## Project Summary

This website is my final project for the GMT-458 Web-GIS course. It was built from scratch to showcase my skills in web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Git) and features a distinct, custom dark-blue design.

The site fully meets all assignment requirements and includes:

* **Custom Theme:** A dark-blue (lacivert) visual theme applied across all pages.
* **Dynamic Visuals:** CSS animations on the homepage (global image slide-in, photo hover, menu pulse).
* **OpenLayers Map:** A dedicated "My Map" page demonstrating OpenLayers integration with a custom dark/grey filter and two location markers (Ankara and Beylikdüzü).
* **Professional Content:** Experience sections detailing my internships at Başarsoft and HDI Global Insurance.

## Project Structure & Navigation

* **Home Page:** My personal profile, photo, and an animated background visual.
* **Projects & Internships:** Detailed summary of my professional experience and project work.
* **My Map:** Interactive map showing relevant locations.
* **Contact / Social:** All my contact and social media links.

## Final Notes on Development and AI Use

### AI Assistance and Learning

Throughout this project, I treated AI tools as a helpful assistant to overcome technical blockers and explore advanced styling techniques.

**Key Learning from AI:**
I successfully implemented a sophisticated visual enhancement by learning how to use the **CSS `filter` property (specifically `invert` and `grayscale`)** on the OpenLayers canvas. This was crucial for achieving the final dark-themed map look on the `My Map` page, ensuring consistency with the site's lacivert theme.

**Total AI Usage Percentage:**
My estimated AI usage for concept validation and debugging code snippets is **30%** of the total development time.
