# Personal Web Page Project for GMT-458 Web-GIS

## Project Summary

This project is my personal website, created as an assignment for the GMT-458 Web-GIS course. The site demonstrates my skills in HTML, CSS, Git, and includes integration of the **OpenLayers** mapping library.

The website is composed of three main pages:
1.  `index.html` (Homepage with OpenLayers map)
2.  `projects.html` (Projects list with image-supported tabular data)
3.  `social.html` (Contact and social links)

## Project Status and Requirements

* **HTML:** Three separate HTML files are included.
* **CSS:** Includes custom styling, a responsive tabular layout with images, and a CSS animation on the main title.
* **OpenLayers (OL):** An interactive map is successfully integrated into the homepage (`index.html`).
* **Git:** Regular use of Git was maintained with at least 3 commits across different days.

## AI Usage Report

In compliance with the assignment rules, here is the report on AI assistance:

**Specific Concept Learned from AI:**
I used AI to learn and implement the advanced CSS animation technique using the `@keyframes` rule and the `transform: translateX()` property. This was essential for creating the smooth, sliding entrance effect on the main `h1` heading.

**Estimate of Total AI Usage:**
Total AI usage is estimated at **1 hour, percentage is %30**.
